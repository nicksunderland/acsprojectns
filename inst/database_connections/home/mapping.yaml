## A configuration file is a list of objects. The objects are dictionaries
## (structures with keys mapped to values). There are four kinds of objects,
## determined by which of the following keys is present in the object:
## "database", "table", or "column", or "include"  Configuration files can be
## included, but the top level of the included file must always be a list
## (meaning the top level elements begin with a dash). The include line itself
## is always prefixed by a dash, making the include key an element of a list.
## The effect of the include is to copy all the contents of the included
## file into the list which contained the original include.
##
## The valid keys in each of the object are as follows:
##
## -- Database --
## Keys: database   the name of the database (unique key in the list)
##       docs       a description of what the database contains
##       source     the underlying source database (informational)
##       tables     a list of table objects stored in the database,
##                  or include objects storing tables
##
## -- Table --
## Keys: table     the name of the table (unique key in the list)
##       docs      a description of what the table contains
##       source    the fully-qualified table name
##       columns   a list of column objects stored in the database,
##                 or include objects storing columns
##
## -- Column --
## Keys: column    the name of the column (unique key in the list)
##       docs      a description of what the database
##       source    a list of column names to draw values from
##       strategy  a rule to use to combine the underlying columns
